I started this blog when I had nothing but time on my hands. Then, suddenly, I had things that needed to be done and I had to go into grind mode. Now, things are leveling off for me and I can come up for air and *breathe*.

I finally got to take my eye off the grindstone and look up... and realized that it's been almost three months since I updated this blog. So, I'm setting a goal for myself to update at least once a week. This isn't a niche blog. I have varied interests, so I'm going to write about all of them.

A lot of stuff has happened to me in the last couple of months. Some things didn't work out, but the most important thing did work out. After a year of diligent searching I finally got a remote job. I applied one day, interviewed two days later, had a second interview a day after the first one, and received a job offer a day after that. I just finished my first week on the job, and it was great.

Don't give up, my friends. Persevere. You never know when things are going to start working in your favor, and if you give up you will never find out. Life comes at you fast. Be ready to catch it.
