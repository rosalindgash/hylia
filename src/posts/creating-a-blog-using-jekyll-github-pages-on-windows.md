I'm going to admit up front that I don't remember everything about my **two full days** of fighting with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). I did so much troubleshooting and Google-fu that I don't remember any steps and everything is all mixed up in my head. So, my observations are going to be general.

And, generally, the entire experience sucked.

First, Jekyll is not user-friendly because its installation instructions are written by programmers for other programmers. Second, it seems that most of the people installing Jekyll are using [MacOS](https://www.apple.com/macos/big-sur/) or [Linux](https://www.linux.org/) and use the command line, exclusively.  

People using [Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows) have access to a terminal to use the command line, but one of the biggest selling points of Windows computers is that users don't have to be technical. So, because of its ease of use users have to take extra steps and, in my opinion, it's just not worth the rigmarole. 

Why? Because neither Jekyll nor GitHub Pages is the only option available. They're also not the only free options available. It took a fraction of the time to get this blog up and running that it took for me to fail at installing Jekyll on GitHub Pages. And the only reason this blog wasn't instantaneously is because I had to wait for my custom domain to propagate. I went to bed and when I woke up everything was ready to go.

Let me back up for just a second. I want to clarify that starting a Jekyll blog on GitHub Pages isn't hard. GitHub Pages runs on Jekyll so it's very easy to get a blog started - *but that's only if you like one of the thirteen themes that GitHub Pages has preinstalled*. If you're fine with one of these themes, you just select one in a theme chooser and your blog is ready to go. Easy peasy. But, if you don't want to use on of the preinstalled themes, you have to install Jekyll yourself, and that's where the issues start popping up.
