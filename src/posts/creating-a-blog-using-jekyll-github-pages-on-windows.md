I'm going to admit up front that I don't remember everything about my two day fight with Jekyll and GitHub Pages. I did so much troubleshooting and Google-fu that I don't remember any steps and everything is all mixed up in my head. So, my observations are going to be general.

First, Jekyll is not user-friendly because its installation instructions are written by programmers for other programmers. Second, it seems that most of the people installing Jekyll are using MacOS or Linux and use the command line. 

People using Windows have to take extra steps and, in my opinion, it's just not worth the rigmarole because Jekyll on GitHub Pages isn't the only option available. It's also not the only free option available. I fought with Jekyll and GitHub Pages for **two full days** and lost miserably. It took a fraction of the time to get up and running with Eleventy on Netlify, and the only reason it wasn't instantaneous is because I had to wait for my custom domain to propagate. I went to bed and when I woke up everything was ready to go.

Let me back up for just a second. I want to clarify that starting a Jekyll blog on GitHub Pages isn't hard. GitHub Pages runs on Jekyll so it's very easy to get a blog started - but that's only if you like one of the thirteen themes that GitHub Pages has preinstalled. If you're fine with one of these themes, you just select one in a theme chooser and your blog is ready to go. Easy peasy. But, if you don't want to use on of the preinstalled themes, you have to install Jekyll yourself, and that's where the issues start popping up.
