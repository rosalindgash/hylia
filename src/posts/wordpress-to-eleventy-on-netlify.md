I've exclusively blogged using WordPress since it was [b2 by cafelog](http://cafelog.com/). I still remember getting the email telling me about it being forked into two different projects and finally making a decision about which project (or neither) to move forward with. 

WordPress is super easy to set up, even manually, and you can do amazing things with it. But, in my opinion, as it has grown it's no longer a great option for people who just want to blog and don't need the showiest themes. 

I just want to write and get my thoughts out. I want an attractive, but not "busy" theme to showcase my words, and I want my website to load fast because people have things to do. So, I'm giving static site generators a try. My first try was with Jekyll on Github, but that didn't work out. I think I'll write about that experience next.
