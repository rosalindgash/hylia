[Technical Documentation Project](https://rosalindgash.github.io/technical-documentation/) - One of the final projects required to earn the 300-hour certification in Responsive Web Design from freeCodeCamp.

[VA Medical Centers](https://rosalindgash.github.io/vamc/) - This was a passion project that I coded in Bootstrap in 2018. I was researching relocation options and one of my must-haves was being close to a highly regarded VA medical center. The information provided by the VA was confusing and not user-friendly. So, using the VA's own star ratings system I created a paginated table sortable by VA medical center name, city, state and star rating with an additional column for the links to their respective websites.
